# java_projects 

## **Brookdale Community College**

In this repository is a majority of all the java assignments that were either done in class or
assigned for homework from my professors at Brookdale Community College. While some of these
classes at Brookdale could have been more in depth and a little more meticulous to better help
prepare future transfer students like myself. The classes were still taught very professionally
and the fundamental and essential java skill sets and knowledge were presented in a way to 
students so that they could easily interpret and understand them.

Each java project should be self explanatory, the file name and comments should explain the
premis of every project file.
